# GameDesignProject

This game was completed as a project for my Game design course. I have always been interested in making 8-bit games and with this project I was able to grasp the basic of it using Unreal Engine 5.

I have made this game solely on bluperints and flipbooks for core concepts. No C++ files were used. I used Cobra Codes tutorials on youtube for certain animations and creation of the level.
